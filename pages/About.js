            Melbourne Australia 🇦🇺 .<br /> Currently, I am working on some
            personal projects such as an E-commerce Website, MovieApp, and

            Ever since my childhood I have been interested in Tehnology
            <br /> and always wanted to learn how the Technology works. And so
            <br /> I knew that I had to pursue computers when I grew up. I
            <br />
            managed to get admission and pursue degree in
            <br /> Software Engineering. I got hooked to Javascript when I
            <br />
            started coding and was fasinated about the echosystem.
            <br /> ReactJS and NextJS is what i love to work with.

            I love travelling and planes. My first flight to Italy
            <br /> made me fall in love with travelling. I love to travel in
            <br />
            different Airlines ✈️ and experience different aircrafts. I
            <br />
            love recording good moments and love watching them after
            <br /> couple of years. Another thing i enjoy is the Crypto
            <br /> Market. I love to learn about how the crypto world works. I
            am too much fascinated about Web3 and Blockchain.
